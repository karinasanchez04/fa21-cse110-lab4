1) values added: 20  
2) final result: 20  
3) values added: 20   
4) Line 13 would return an error because that line is not in the same 
   block that the variable is defined in. Therefore result cannot be accessed.
5) Line 9 would return an error because a const variable cannot be reassigned as we try
   to do in line 7. Therefore it would return an error.  
6) Line 13 would also return an error because a const variable cannot be reassigned as we try
   to do in line 7. Therefore it would return an error and never reach line 13.
